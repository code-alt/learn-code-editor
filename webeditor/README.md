I'M BACK

No, I didn't die.

It's been five years of me actively doing nothing. That's gotta *stop.*

Five years...

Since it's been five years here is a little story: 
Five years back, I just started dev and wanted to try a few things. Knowing little to nothing I wanted to teach others. I started to dev simple apps to try and "teach" people with them. I got a homepage app on and slapped on CC-BY-SA 4.0. As I progress, I start getting better and better and programming. In the year 2017 (I think?) I join Glitch.com and start porting most of my work there. I put a few more restrictions on my instances which was CC BY-NC-ND on my old one when I started getting into it. I changed it back somewhere else (but not on Glitch.com.) My first Learn Code project on Glitch.com however was *terrible.* Even I don't know where I have it (if I still have it.) It was v1, and the only v1, though. The next one, which I kinda talked about already (how it was CC BY-NC-ND) was v2. And v3. However the editor got bumped up to v4 for some reason. My first editor for the new one just relied on textboxes, which I guess was better than v1. (inputs) v3 was waay better, with CodeMirror, themes, files, languages, even yt in there! v4 added a secret physics lib which made everything fall and bounce around. It works still, just breaks if you head off the page. Around this time I posted this all on Glitch's Forum, which the topic still exists. This was from 2017-2019. In 2020, which was that year that banger virus started going around was the start of Learn Code v4. Learn Code Editor v5 brought a shiny new badge (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) that also got replaced on different hosts I had. Learn Code v4 is when I started getting into graphic design. I made quite a lot of drawings and I loved it. Learn Code v4 totally did not take the design of coloors which I used quite a lot in dev at the time. Finally we jump to now. I spend too much time doing and liking stuff that I don't have anytime to do any dev. 

But..

Learn Code Editor v6
and
Learn Code v5 appear

It couldn't be.

v5 is a completely revamped version redone completely from nothing, with the best UI you could ever see, completely, 100% responsive.

(editor v5 and v6 are designed for an ipod btw)

see ya,
code-alt (learn code's only developer.)
